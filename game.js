// When someone opens the game, the game header will says it's player1's turn
// The player will choose a space and their token will be placed in that box.
// after they choose a space, player2 will take a turn. their token will be played on the game box they choose.
//The turns will continue until someone either gets a winning combination or 
//someone goes 5 times and the "its a draw" message pops up at the top. The player who wins will have their score increment by one. 
//After a few seconds, the game board automatically resets and the message at the top of the page goes back to saying "it's player1's turn"
// If the users want to clear their scores, they can click a button at the bottom of the page, and it will reset the entire game.
