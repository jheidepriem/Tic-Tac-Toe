# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Learning Goals:
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of: 
  - DRY JavaScript
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Abstract:
Love Tic-Tac-Toe? Also love tacos and burritos? Than this Tic-Tac-Toe game is right for you! Player 1 includes a burrito token and player 2 includes a taco token. Players alternate taking turns and the game automatically saved your wins to local storage. When you want to start over fresh, simply clear your board/wins at the click of a button.

### Wins + Challenges:
Some challenges included: 
- Dom bugs were a challenge when trying to figure out the appropriate way to disable and enable the board as well as updating the game header correctly. 

Some wins included:
- Making the game fully playable in dev tools using only the data-model. 
- Finding dryer ways to iterate through arrays rather than having long conditionals or gross nested for loops.
